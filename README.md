This Repository contains my working files of "Conversational Q&amp;A Chatbot- Chat With PDF Along With Chat History", an GenAI Project

(i) Implemented an end-to-end conversational Q&A chatbot using Groq API and open-source LLM models like Gamma-2, capable of interacting with PDF documents.

(ii) Developed a Streamlit web app allowing users to upload PDFs, enter queries, and maintain session-based chat history for contextual responses.

(iii) Created vector embeddings of PDF content using HuggingFace embeddings and stored them in Chroma for efficient retrieval.

(iv) Designed history-aware retrievers and prompt templates to provide accurate answers referencing previous conversations.

(v) Enabled summarization of chat history and provided detailed, concise answers using RAG-based retrieval from PDFs.

(vi) Demonstrated real-time interaction with uploaded documents, preserving context across multiple user queries.
